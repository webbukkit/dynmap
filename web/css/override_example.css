/*******************
 * This is the over-ride CSS file.
 *
 * if you know any CSS you can easily add custom rules to change how DynMap
 * looks and behaves under your DynMap installation.
 *
 * 1. Uncomment the override.css in the index.html.
 * 2. Rename this file or create a new override.css.
 * 3. Add your own rules (or steal these) to personalize how DynMap looks.
 *
 * By adding your own rules here, you can then save your changes 
 * between DynMap updates and they won't get over-written.
